This is a project for Bench. 

This project is built by react, and typeScirpt

It loads pagenation data from API

<b>It did not remove any duplicate data. thinking in the real world those may not be the duplicated. Need to be confirmed.</b> 

and then display it on a page and also output the sum of all the amount

<b>Right now the Date and Company can be sorted by clicking on it</b>

Additional Modules i am using for this project are<br/>
1. axios it handles fetch better than the js Fetch()<br/>
2. classnames. so i can use multi classname for one element<br/>

To run the project<br/>
1. please run <b>npm install</b> <br/>
2. <b>npm start</b>

In the real world, if it is a much bigger data set, i will set redux or any other state management system to handle data and may suggest to use GraphQl to handle what data need to be loaded
